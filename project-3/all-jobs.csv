"Data Director Opportunity to drive step change to data offeringEstablished agency group, strong ground in data and analyticsInspiring leader, grow your own team, deliver thought leadershipSALARY - £80k - £100k & benefits LOCATION - Remote to begin with, then Central London THE OPPORTUNITY Joining this successful well established agency group at a time of positive change and investment into the data offering.Gone are the days of a scattered, disjointed approach to data and analytics - the CDO here has been working hard for the last year to harmonise and re-group all their talented data professionals into one centralised core. This data team currently sits at 30 people strong and includes skilled experts in data science, econometrics, social media analysis and research as well as customer insight, campaign evaluation and modelling - and whilst they remain firmly in their specialisms  they now also spend 20% of their time focused on omnichannel projects, driving bigger thinking around how analysis can be applied to provide a more holistic service to their clients. Historically 1st party data has been the cornerstone of all their projects, but now its thinking about how media and social fits in and managing the team from a broader perspective. Key clients currently include: Global mobile telecoms provider - who are nearing the end of their transformation, with the agency supporting on the journey orchestration project, doing all the data strategy. Retailer - they lead their global CRM strategy and are currently developing their loyalty programme Retailer - access to their database delivering predictive analytics projects So, we are seeking a fairly hands off leader, who can continue to connect the dots and build on the offering, building credibility internally as well as externally around the data services available. There is huge support and financial investment from the  board in data, as its been earmarked as one of their 3 core areas of growth. In order to successfully position data as a core service across this multidisciplinary group of agencies, we also need someone who has a broad background in analytics. You will need to understand how digital data can connect to customer data, how MMM (market  mix modelling) and econometrics operate and how ML and AI can accelerate all of these traditional analytics services, in a modern marketing world. THE PERSON You should still be hands on to an extent, able to guide on the detail for a variety of analytical projects, whilst educating lots of different stakeholders to the art of whats possible using data science and analytics. You will have a team of four Analysts,  Data Scientist and Data Strategists but will also work with the CDO to grow a team as the agency moves forward and evolves their data offering. Technically you have a plethora of tech to work with including Salesforce and Adobe, SQL, R and Python. Finally, we need adaptable, ambitious, creative thought leaders. People who are engaged with not only the ultimate vision of this Director, but also understand the groundwork that needs to go into making such a change. Skills and experience required: Educated to degree level in a numerate subject; Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Machine Learning, Computer Science etc.A strong background in customer and marketing analytics, with more recent exposure to data science techniquesIdeally an understanding of how media and social analytics plug into customer and marketing analytics, as well as data scienceA background using programming skills in either R or Python, delivering analytical and data science projects yourself once is a must in order to lead from the front, and potentially get your hands dirty from time to timeIdeally experience of using a range of machine learning and AI techniquesIdeally industry experience in marketing or advertisingA problem solving approach, ability to apply advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to solve real world business challengesA curious nature, and inquisitive nature plus an ability to build strong relationships with clients, direct reports and senior level stakeholders"|"Data Director - reed.co.uk"|"2021-03-26"|"£85,000 - £100,000 per annum"|"London"|"Permanent, full-time"|"Blue Pelican"|"Recruitment consultancy"|"Marketing And Media"
